# Starter HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Template

This is a basic template for a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a navigation bar with five links, and it's designed to be a reusable starting point for web projects.

## Features:
Fixed Navbar: The navbar stays at the top of the page while scrolling.
Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a navbar link scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section.
Transparent Navbar on Scroll: The navbar becomes transparent as you scroll down and reverts to a solid color when at the top of the page.
Scrollable Sections: Multiple sections with content to make the page scrollable.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:


### **index.html**
The main HTML file includes:
- A navigation bar with 5 links
- Sections for "Home", "About", "Services", "Portfolio", and "Contact"

### **styles.css**
The CSS file contains:
- Basic styles for layout and typography
- Styling for the navigation bar, sections, and footer
- A simple reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers

### **script.js**
The JavaScript file is used for adding future interactivity. Currently, it just logs a welcome message to the console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
No additional software or tools are required to run this template. You can open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

### Running the Project
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Customizing the Template
- Modify the content in the `index.html` file to suit your needs.
- Update the CSS in `styles.css` to change the design.
- Add more JavaScript functionality in `script.js` as needed.

## How It Works:
**HTML:**

The index.html file contains the structure, including the navbar with links to sections.
Each section (<section>) is identified with a unique id, so the navbar links can jump to them.
**CSS:**

The navbar is styled to stay fixed at the top of the page.
Sections are styled with padding and spacing to make them scrollable.
The transparent navbar effect is achieved with rgba in CSS, making it semi-transparent when scrolling.

**JavaScript:**

The script listens for scroll events. If the user scrolls down, the navbar becomes transparent. If the user scrolls back to the top, it returns to its solid form.
Smooth scrolling is enabled on click of the navbar links, ensuring a smooth transition to the sections.
Customization:
Adjust the scroll-margin-top value in styles.css to accommodate the height of your navbar.
Modify the background color, font size, and other styles in styles.css to match your design.
